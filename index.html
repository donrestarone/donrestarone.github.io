	<h1> Shashike J: Full Stack Web-Dev | Researcher | Technologist</h1>
		<p> 
			Avid reader, critical thinker, enthusiast of all things mechanical and self-proclaimed polymath. When I was a kid I didn't just play with my toys I disassembled them, much to the dismay of my parents. It was in an attempt to understand their inner workings and this habit carried on, from building computers to tuning cars. My curiosity leads me down many rabbit holes and when I'm not developing WebApps, I'm doing adventure drives, working out or just relaxing with friends and craft beer.
